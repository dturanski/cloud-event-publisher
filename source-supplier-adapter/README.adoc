= Source Supplier Adapter

Core library to adapt a Spring Cloud Stream Source component as a `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>`

This provides auto configuration for:

* A Stub Binder that satisfies configuration added by `@EnableBinding` which is included in the OOTB Spring Cloud Stream App starters
* The Supplier function backed by a `@ServiceActivator` on `Source.OUTPUT`

Including this as a dependency along with the app starter exposes the Supplier.
